## integration_worktree_plan
- Integration surface: one integration worktree per bounded batch
- Base ref: `main`
- Worktree path: <worktree_path>
- Worktree audit object: `false`
- Evidence audit object: `true`

## gate_plan
- Authority gate scope: parent contract conformance
- Contract package gate scope: child contract validity
- Artifact conformance gate scope: runtime artifacts under merged child contract
- Required checks:
  - <check_1>

## promotion_plan
- Promotion mode: `patch_promotion`
- Target branch: <target_branch>
- Required evidence refs:
  - <evidence_ref_1>
- Post-promotion gates:
  - main_authority_gate
  - main_contract_package_gate
  - main_artifact_conformance_gate

## rollback_plan
- Rollback mode: retain worktree and reject promotion
- Rollback trigger:
- Recovery action:

## decision
- Status: `APPROVED` | `REJECTED` | `NEEDS_INFO`
- Decision rationale:
- Blocking items (if `REJECTED`):
- Required follow-up evidence:

## implement
- Mode: `dry-run`
- Git flow reference: `references/git_flow.md`
- Evidence required:
  - <fill>
- Execution command(s):

## success_criteria
- [ ] Request and batch artifacts validate.
- [ ] Required checks are enumerated for the integration worktree.
- [ ] Promotion path is explicit and rollback-aware.
