# Loop

Meta-skill for routing and controlling bounded-batch lifecycle loops.

## Worktree contract

- `$wt` is the git-flow integration worktree for the source repo under execution.
- `$ledger_wt` is a separate Git worktree of the loop ledger repo at `/home/_404/src/loop_ledger`.
- `PLAN` and `IMPLEMENT` packets are produced under `$wt/{PLAN,IMPLEMENT}` unless a project-specific contract says otherwise.
- Review manifests, copied evidence, and shareable review bundles are materialized through `$ledger_wt`.
- Do not overload `$wt` to mean the ledger surface. The two paths have different roles and must stay explicit.

## Child skill routing

- `PLAN` phase -> use `plan` skill.
- `IMPLEMENT` phase -> use `implement` skill.
- `VERIFY` phase -> use `scripts/validate_contract_bridge.py`.

## State machine

`INIT -> PLAN -> DECISION -> IMPLEMENT -> VERIFY -> TERMINATE`
